# Exploring the Relationship between Alignment and Cross-lingual Transfer in Multilingual Transformers

Code for the paper: Exploring the Relationship between Alignment and Cross-lingual Transfer in Multilingual Transformers. FÃ©lix Gaschi, Patricio Cerda, Parisa Rastin, Yannick Toussaint. Findings of ACL 2023 (link coming soon)

## Requirements

This was tested in Python 3.9, with requirements provided in `requirements.txt`, where `wandb` is actually optional and `brokenaxes` is only useful for generating figures.

## How to use

All the scripts are meant to be run from the run of the repository (e.g. `scripts/2023_acl/reproduce_all_opus100.sh` instead of `cd scripts/2023_acl && ./reproduce_all_opus100.sh`).

### Recommended usage

`reproduce_all_opus100.sh` allows to perform all experiments present in the paper, except those concerning the Multi-UN dataset (in Appendix). But it would take a very long time to run entirely.

Instead it is recommended to download the preprocessed realignment data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12mrv3tUHNvGLCYtjiv6VackjmNtW_PRn/view?usp=sharing).

Then you can run any of the two main scripts on it:

- `finetuning_and_alignment.py` is the main script for the experiment where multilingual alignment is measured before and after fine-tuning (then we can look at correlation, drop in alignment etc...)
- `controlled_realignment.py` is the main script for comparing different realignment methods (before or during fine-tuning and with different aligners)

Options of those scripts are specified below.

By default, this scripts produces CSV files with the raw data produced by the experiments. Figures from the papers can then be reproduced from those CSV files using the scripts in the `generate_figures` subdirectory.

### Finetuning and alignment

`finetuning_and_alignment.py` measure multilingual alignment before and after fine-tuning (then we can look at correlation, drop in alignment etc...).

### Reproducing all the results

To retrieve all the data and run all the experiments at once, there are the two following scripts:

- `reproduce_all_opus100.sh` allows to perform all experiments present in the paper, except those concerning the Multi-UN dataset (in Appendix)
- `realignment_with_multiun.sh` allows to perform those additional experiments with the multi-UN dataset

Given a directory DATA_DIR where everything will be stored (preprocessed datasets and all), either of the two scripts can be used as follows:

```
bash scripts/2023_acl/reproduce_all_opus100.sh DATA_DIR
```

Please note that adding `--debug` to this command will allow you to do a relatively quick test run of all the experiments.
